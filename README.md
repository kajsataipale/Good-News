## The assignment was to create a news feed site with blog posts.

### List of criterias for this assignment

- Title <br>

### Languages

This project is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository (locally) or download as a zip to your desktop <br>
2. Launch MAMP  or similar local web server on your computer (if you don't have a local sever, go and download it.<br>
3. Locate the downloaded file or the cloned directory in your local server.<br>
4. Open up the browser and enter this (if you are on mac) "localhost:8888" or (if you are on windows, depending on open ports) "http://localhost:8888"<br>

### Extra
I have added profile pictures that's linked to a specific author.  
Also tried to add a working like button to every post,
but it's a work in progress. <br>For now the like button only works on the first post.
