## The assignment was to create a news feed site with blog posts.

### The list of criterias for this assignment was

-> Title <br>
-> Content<br>
-> Author<br>
-> Published date<br>
-> Like counter (the number of likes a news feed item has received)



### Getting started

1, Clone this repository (locally) to your desktop <br>
2, Launch mamP on your computer (if you dont have mamP, go to and[download](https://www.mamp.info/en/) it.)<br>
3, Locate the cloned directory in mamP<br>
4, Open up the browser and enter this (if you are on mac) "localhost:8888" or (if you are on windows, depending on open ports) "http://localhost:8888"<br>
5, Due to that all the data i stored in your cloned directory you are now set.

### Extra
I have added profile pictures that's linked to a specific author.  
Also tried to add a working like button to every post,
but it's a work in progress. For now the like button only works on the first post.
